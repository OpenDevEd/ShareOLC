When pressing 'share' the following text is made available to applications that can receive text intents:

ShareOLC. olc:5GRF2F3V+8MM  geo:37.7749,-122.4194 height:241m sat:10/17 acc:high,3m sensor:1,2,3,4 https://www.google.com/maps/search/-13.9966875,29.4898101 https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/-13.9467/29.5151 

In this, "sensor:" contains additional GPS sensor data, such as raw values for horizontal and vertical accuracy. The items are separated by <space>, but could also be separated e.g. by ";", as long as that works. I'll provide links for Google Maps etc.  If possible, the following should be made available to apps that can receive geo intents:

geo:37.7749,-122.4194
