Collecting geodata is important, especially in times of crisis. For a good example how geodata and maps can help, have a look at https://hotosm.org.

There are many many apps that can collect geodata, including apps such as WhatsApp. However, when we have collected geodata with colleagues in sub-Saharan Africa, working with health workers in remote areas, there are problems. For example, a member of staff in the head office (e.g., the regional branch of the Ministry of Health) is asked a health worker in a rural area to communicate their location. Here are some of the problems that arise:

- The health worker may not know to go outside (as they may not be familiar with how GPS works).
- The health worker may not have connectivity, so their phone doesn't utilise AGPs. They may not know that they need to stay outside for about 15 minutes for the phone to acquire a location.
- When the phone has acquired location, the health worker may not have internet to share the location digitally. Instead, they write it down on paper, or read it out over the phone. When reading out latitude and longitude, it's easy to make errors.

Even if the health worker has internet, most simple applications just share the location. The recipient does not know how accurate the location was. There are of course many more complicated applications that do this, but they are too complicated to use.

The goal for this application is to be as simple as possible, while collecting essential information:
- Location
- Accuracy
while offering advice to the user.
